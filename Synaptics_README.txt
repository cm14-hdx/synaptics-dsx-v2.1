   Example Kconfig for the OMAP Panda board to include the Synaptics DSX
   driver.

drivers/input/touchscreen/Makefile
   Example Makefile for the OMAP Panda board to include the Synaptics DSX
   driver.

firmware/Makefile
   Example Makefile for the OMAP Panda board for the inclusion of the firmware
   image in the kernel build for doing reflash during device initialization.

include/linux/input/synaptics_dsx.h
   The Synaptics DSX header file shared between the device and the driver.

arch/arm/configs/panda_defconfig
   Example defconfig for the OMAP Panda board to include the Synaptics DSX
   driver.

   touch devices.



HOW TO INSTALL THE DRIVER
-------------------------

** Copy the synaptics_dsx folder in drivers/input/touchscreen to the
   equivalent directory in your kernel tree.

** Copy synaptics_dsx.h in include/linux/input to the equivalent directory
   in your kernel tree.

** Update Makefile and Kconfig in your kernel tree's drivers/input/touchscreen
   directory to include support for building the Synaptics DSX driver. Use the
   equivalent files in the tarball as examples.

** Update your defconfig by referring to the defconfig in the tarball as
   an example.

** Update your board file by referring to the board file in the tarball as
   an example.

** "make clean" your kernel.

** "make" your defconfig.

** Rebuild your kernel.

** Install the new kernel on your Android system.

** Reboot your Android system.



HOW TO INCLUDE FIRMWARE IMAGE IN KERNEL BUILD FOR DOING REFLASH
---------------------------------------------------------------

** Convert the .img image file to the .ihex format using the command below.
   objcopy -I binary -O ihex <firmware_name>.img startup_fw_update.img.ihex

** Place startup_fw_update.img.ihex in the firmware/synaptics directory in your
   kernel tree.

** Include the line below in firmware/Makefile (this line is commented out by
   default in the example Makefile in the driver).
   fw-shipped-$(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_FW_UPDATE) += synaptics/startup_fw_update.img

** Rebuild your kernel.
